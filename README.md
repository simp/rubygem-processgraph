# simp-processgraph
This holds the tool we are using to draw the process graphs

This code allows you to plot the communications between your host and others.

* It uses the `lsof` (list open files) command with the `-i4` (using ipv4 protocol) with the `-n` option (converts hostnames to ip addresses),

* It creates an array of hashes of (process id, process name, port, filename, hostname, owner),
and writes the interim data to a file,

* Then it creates a graph, boxing up where the user and process are the same, and at the other end where destinations are the same.
Lines are color-alternated to keep them distinct.


In order to run, you must set up your environment as described in https://simp-project.atlassian.net/wiki/display/SD/Setting+up+your+build+environment

(until you install bundler)
then
$bundle

In order to create the .png files, you must have graphviz installed
```bash
sudo yum install graphviz
```

You may need to install `lsof` in various versions of Linux
```bash
sudo yum install lsof
```

Below are the functions available under rake:

```
rake chmod            # Ensure gemspec-safe permissions on all files
rake clean            # Remove any temporary products
rake clobber          # Remove any generated file
rake default          # default - help
rake help             # help
rake pkg:gem          # build rubygem package for simp-processgraph
rake pkg:install_gem  # build and install rubygem package for simp-processgraph
rake spec             # run all RSpec tests
```


To run the program, type in the command below:

`$ ruby simp-processgraph.rb`

or:

`$ bin\processgraph`

The parameters are:

```
Usage: ruby simp_processgraph.rb [options]


    -h, --help                       Help

    -i, --input filename NAME        Input file or directory name

    -o, --output file NAME           Output file or directory name (will look for files in the directory named *.lsof
```


Or call the two lines below within your ruby:

```ruby
mygraph = SimpProcessGraph_i4.new($inpfile, $outfile)
mygraph.create_dot
```
